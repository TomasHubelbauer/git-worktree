# Git Worktree

In this repository I am experimenting with the `git worktree` command.
It should allow me to check out a repository and then check out a
worktree or multiple so that I can work on multiple branches at the
same time without needing to switch branches and stash changes.

In theory I think it should work like this:

```sh
git clone â€¦
git worktree add worktree-1-directory existing-branch
git worktree add -b new-branch worktree-2-directory
```

I am going to test this out by doing this:

- [x] Creating a new remote branch on GitHub alongside `main`
  https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/git-worktree/tree/tom-test
- [ ] Cloning this repository and checking out the new branch to a worktree
- [ ] Creating a new branch into another worktree
- [ ] Making changes to both worktrees
- [ ] Pushing the changes and checking the diffs against `main`
